### Overview

This application is a fullstack CRUD web application that randomly pairs users in its user database with others to facilitate meet-ups. By utilizing modules such as Express and BCrypt, this application allows for users to sign up for the app, log in to view user-specific information (e.g. their arranged meet-ups), edit their information, and create new meet-ups.
